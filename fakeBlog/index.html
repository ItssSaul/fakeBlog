        <h1>Saul Ulloa</h1>
        <p>I love the ocean. Did you know there are more historic artefacts under the sea than in all of the world’s museums. Our oceans cover more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The world’s longest mountain chain is underwater.</li>
            <li>Earth’s longest chain of mountains, the Mid-Ocean Ridge, is almost entirely beneath the ocean, stretching across a distance of 65,000 kilometres. It’s said that this mountain chain is less explored than the surface of Venus or Mars.</li>
            <li>We still only know a fraction of the marine species in our oceans.</li>
            <li>According to the World Register of Marine Species there are now 240,470 accepted species, but this is believed to be just a small proportion of the species that exist, with new marine life being discovered everyday.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>this is a short video of why I like the ocean.</div>
